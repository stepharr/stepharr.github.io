One year down, lots of impact and changes but still standing strong ...

About a year ago I posted that I was joining the Department of Veteran's Affairs to work on the [vets.gov](https://www.vets.gov) project.  The part of this I didn't talk about was that I was a member of the [USDS](https://usds.gov), mostly because I didn't understand the layout of my new job, even though I came through the USDS hiring pipeline.

A came across a [blog post](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-white-house-plans-to-poach-500-recruits-from-the-private-tech-sector-2015-11) a few months ago that talked about how President Obama was trying to hire 500 technologists to become part of the [USDS](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service).  So I submitted my resume, assuming that it would be until the next administration before it would even be looked at, but I got called within 3 weeks.  Went through 4 initial interviews with the USDS, and finally the [VA](https://va.gov) pulled me into the last interview.  The final interview was great and I was sold on the vision that the upper management at the VA has and the impact that I can personally have on this project and on the lives of veterans.
